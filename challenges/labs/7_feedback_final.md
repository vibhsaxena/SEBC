* * I was warned that this would not be a walk in the park, and was certainly not so. The best part of it was having to do everything by oneself and that enabled learning, as opposed to one having been spoon-fed.
* most helpful topic
* * having to follow path II installation the very first day and setting replication- this i thought was pretty neat. I didn't have a lot of idea about mysql before, this exercise gave many insights. also, hdfs and yarn.
* least familiar topic
* * benchmarking in HDFS and Kerberos. Thankfully, takeawaks! :D
* how long before you are ready to install a prod cluster
*  * hopefully not too long- been able to set up a kerberized cluster here, but need to work on the nitty-gritties of security and benchmarking- just have enough knowledge of how they work, not a deep understanding.
